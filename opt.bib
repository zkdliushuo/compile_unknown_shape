% A few stylistic standards used in these bib entries,
% designed for brevity without sacrificing essential completeness
% (most entries fit on two lines in footnotesize):
% - Short and long conference titles including conference numbers:
%	e.g., 17th \bibbrev{SOSP}{ACM Symposium on Operating System Principles}
% - Use "and others" for papers with more than three or four authors
% - No publisher for conference proceedings; conference name is enough.

  abstract={Computer vision (CV) represents the idea of giving machines the capacity to make meaning out of images frames, and for decades it consisted mostly of laborious and complex techniques that provided poor performance. With the advent of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), CV systems reached levels of accuracy to become industry-relevant. A major challenge, however, resides in deploying real-time CV systems in environments (such as driverless cars) that impose a series of constraints in terms of energy supply, weight and space. This technical paper describes how a real-time embedded image recognition system was developed and how the design guidelines were specified in terms of functionality and performance. A minimum rate of 30 frames per second (fps) was identified as a real-time boundary. Alongside the decision for a DCNN topology, system architecture and software technology, the Nvidia’s Jetson TX2 embedded computer was chosen as the evaluation board. It is described how the image recognition pipeline was benchmarked and evaluated in terms of throughput, power consumption and energy efficiency. The test set-up consisted of remote cameras producing input video streams and a HDMI monitor for presenting the system’s output. Optimizations techniques like reduced precision and batching were implemented to obtain successive improvements of the system’s throughput, while the impact on the other metrics were considered. The best achieved performance was 47,7 fps at a resolution of 1080x720. The numerous intermediate results compose a comprehensive design landscape for different operational scenarios of the system.}

abstract = {There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices. Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms - such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) - requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM's ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia.},

    abstract = {Data movement between processor and memory hierarchy is a fundamental bottleneck that limits the performance of many applications on modern computer architectures. Tiling and loop permutation are key techniques for improving data locality. However, selecting effective tile-sizes and loop permutations is particularly challenging for tensor contractions due to the large number of loops. Even state-of-the-art compilers usually produce sub-optimal tile-sizes and loop permutations, as they rely on na\"{\i}ve cost models. In this paper we provide an analytical model based approach to multi-level tile size optimization and permutation selection for tensor contractions. Our experimental results show that this approach achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art frameworks and libraries for tensor contractions.},

  abstract = {Machine learning powers diverse services in industry including search, translation, recommendation systems, and security. The scale and importance of these models require that they be efficient, expressive, and portable across an array of heterogeneous hardware devices. These constraints are often at odds; in order to better accommodate them we propose a new high-level intermediate representation (IR) called Relay. Relay is being designed as a purely-functional, statically-typed language with the goal of balancing efficient compilation, expressiveness, and portability. We discuss the goals of Relay and highlight its important design constraints. Our prototype is part of the open source NNVM compiler framework, which powers Amazon's deep learning framework MxNet.},

  abstract = {The validation and deployment of novel research ideas in the field of Deep Learning is often limited by the availability of efficient compute kernels for certain basic primitives. In particular, operations that cannot leverage existing vendor libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, cuDNN) are at risk of facing poor device utilization unless custom implementations are written by experts – usually at the expense of portability. For this reason, the development of new programming abstractions for specifying custom Deep Learning workloads at a minimal performance cost has become crucial. We present Triton, a language and compiler centered around the concept of tile, i.e., statically shaped multi-dimensional sub-arrays. Our approach revolves around (1) a C-based language and an LLVM-based intermediate representation (IR) for expressing tensor programs in terms of operations on parametric tile variables and (2) a set of novel tile-level optimization passes for compiling these programs into efficient GPU code. We demonstrate how Triton can be used to build portable implementations of matrix multiplication and convolution kernels on par with hand-tuned vendor libraries (cuBLAS / cuDNN), or for efficiently implementing recent research ideas such as shift convolutions.},

  abstract={This work proposes an algorithm, called NetAdapt, that automatically adapts a pre-trained deep neural network to a mobile platform given a resource budget. While many existing algorithms simplify networks based on the number of MACs or weights, optimizing those indirect metrics may not necessarily reduce the direct metrics, such as latency and energy consumption. To solve this problem, NetAdapt incorporates direct metrics into its adaptation algorithm. These direct metrics are evaluated using empirical measurements, so that detailed knowledge of the platform and toolchain is not required. NetAdapt automatically and progressively simplifies a pre-trained network until the resource budget is met while maximizing the accuracy. Experiment results show that NetAdapt achieves better accuracy versus latency trade-offs on both mobile CPU and mobile GPU, compared with the state-of-the-art automated network simplification algorithms. For image classification on the ImageNet dataset, NetAdapt achieves up to a 1.7{\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}speedup in measured inference latency with equal or higher accuracy on MobileNets (V1{\&}V2).},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices. Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms - such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) - requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM's ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},
