\begin{abstract}
% Evolution of deep learning models motives various Domin-Specific Accelerators (DSAs) to deliver high performance and efficiency.
% Among these DSAs, Huawei Ascend series NPUs have been widely adopted in both cloud and edge scenarios.
Industrial deep learning (DL) frameworks and serving systems depend on DL operator libraries to support various model architectures and dynamic input shapes.
Conseqeuently, device kernel functions of deep learning operators are designed in a unified manner, highly configurable through parameters that govern inter-core parallelism and intra-core pipelining strategies, adjusting to different input shapes and models.
However, current compiler stack faces challenges when optimize these operators with numerous kernel parameters, especially on Ascend, a widely used domin-specific accelerator (DSA) which is excellent at tensor and vector computation but relatively weak at scalar computation.
It is observed that many of these parameters are actually invariable given model and hardware configurations.
The key to optimize is to identify and leverage such invariable parameters during compilation to reduce scalar operations and thus improve kernel performance. 
In this paper, we present \mysys, a framework that automatically infers invariable parameters for deep learning operators and then specializes kernels.
\mysys is designed to tackle a series of challenges when propagate information of invariants across multiple compilation layers from front-end Python runtime to host-side programs and finally to device kernel functions.
We implement \mysys on Ascend platform and evaluate it with a variety of dynamic shape operators from mainstream deep learning models.
The results demonstrate that \mysys can achieve up to 1.17$\times$ speedup on operators compared to the baseline compiler with reasonable compilation overhead, and 1.04$\times$ speedup on end-to-end Large Language Models (LLMs) inference.
Besides, \mysys shows potential on debloating operator libraries using inferred invariants for accelerators like GPUs.
